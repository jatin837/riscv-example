# What is an Instruction Set Architecture?

- Defines the software interface for hardware
- **Single ISA** -> Many hardware implementations
- An __ISA__ specification may be for general purpose microprocessor, DSPs, specialized hardware operations.
- An ISA creates it's own software ecosystem. (x86, ARM, IBM 360)

# What is included in an ISA?

+ Set of instruction, how they behave
+ Data Types
+ Registers
+ Addressing modes
+ Memory model
+ How Input/ Output is done
+ Virtual Memory
+ Exceptions
