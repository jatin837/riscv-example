# What is an Instruction Set Architecture?

- Defines the software interface for hardware
- **Single ISA** -> Many hardware implementations
- An __ISA__ specification may be for general purpose microprocessor, DSPs, specialized hardware operations.
- An ISA creates it's own software ecosystem. (x86, ARM, IBM 360)

# What is included in an ISA?

+ Set of instruction, how they behave
+ Data Types
+ Registers
+ Addressing modes
+ Memory model
+ How Input/ Output is done
+ Virtual Memory
+ Exceptions


# What is RISC V?

RISC V is **A Well organized ISA** devided into _categories and extensions_.

# Origin of RISC V

In 2010 at **UC Berkeley**, **Kryste Asanovic** started the design as a 3-momth summer project.

Principal designers:
- Andrew Waterman
- Yunsup Lee
- David Patterson
- Kryste Asanovic


May 2014: the base user spec released after many iterations.

**RISC-V is the 5th ISA designed at Berkeley**

- RISC-1(1981)
- RISC-2(1983)
- RISC-3(1984)
- RISC-4(1988)
- RISC-5(2011)


# Why RISC-V?

+ Simplicity(RISC arch)
+ Open Source
	- No IP or liscence restrictions
+ New Business model
+ On par with modern CPUS(performance, code density, power consumption)


# RISC-V ISA
